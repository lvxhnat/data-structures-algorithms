# Palindrome

Given an integer ```x```, return ```true``` if ```x``` is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.


n integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

For example, ```121``` is a palindrome while ```123``` is not.

**Examples:** 

Input: ```x = 121```\
Output: ```true```\
Explanation: ```121``` reads as ```121``` from left to right and from right to left.

Input: ```x = -121```\
Output: ```false```\
Explanation: From left to right, it reads ```-121```. From right to left, it becomes ```121-```. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Input: ```x = 10```\
Output: ```false```\
Explanation: Reads ```01``` from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

**Constraints:**

```-231 <= x <= 231 - 1```
 
Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
